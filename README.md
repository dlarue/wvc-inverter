# WVC Micro Inverter Flow for Node Red

Node red flows to control and collect data from the WVC series of micro inverters. The inverter is sold under various brand names around the world. [Manufacturer website.](http://www.kaidengdg.com/en/pvsystem.html)

Features available in these flows:

* Set up multiple micro inverters.
* Display realtime data from each inverter.
* Collect energy production data from each inverter.
* Limit energy production to prevent grid backfeed (requires external energy meter input).
* Compile data from all inverters into a graphical format.
* Generates MQTT events from inverter data.

### Prerequisites

* WVC Micro Inverter
* WVC Wireless Modem
* Computer with USB or serial port running [Node Red](https://nodered.org)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) installed on the same computer.
* Access to an MQTT broker if you want to make use of the MQTT messages.

### Node Red Nodes

The flows depend on the following additional nodes that need to be added:

* node-red-contrib-bigmongo
* node-red-contrib-objectid
* node-red-dashboard
* node-red-node-serialport

### Installing

If MongoDB is not installed on your system, follow operating system specific instructions to install it. By default the flow uses a mongodb server on localhost on the default port with no authentication. Go through all MongoDB nodes and change that if needed.

Install required nodes from the node red sandwich menu 'Manage Palette'.

Download each flow and copy to clipboard using any text editor. Then choose 'Import -> Clipboard' from the node red sandwich menu for each flow.

By default MQTT messages will be sent to an MQTT broker on the default port on localhost. Go through all MQTT nodes and change that if needed.

Setup the correct serial port in the serial nodes in the "Query Inverters" flow. By default /dev/ttyUSB0 is used.

Connect the wireless modem to your computer's USB or serial port. Make sure both the inverter and the modem are powered.

Make a note of the four character hex coded inverter id found on the label on the inverter. Go to the Node Red dashboard and open up the "WVC Inverter Control tab". Type in the inverter id, choose the correct model and click "Add".

Note that the inverter transmits no data if it's not generating electricity or it's not connected to the grid.

## Notes

The Solar gauge in the Instant Power tab shows the sum of the real time DC power generated by all inverters multiplied by the efficiency (0.9). The inverter does also report real time AC current and voltage. The manufacturer provides a lookup table for the power factor in relation to the generated current, but since the actual power factor will vary widely depending on the load this will not be accurate enough. Empiric tests suggest that DC power multiplied by efficiency provides a more realistic number for the power being generated.
